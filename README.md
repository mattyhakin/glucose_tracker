## 📥 First Setup

When first cloning or using the app:

- The real working data is located in the `data/` folder.
- If you prefer to start fresh, copy the blank templates from the `templates/` folder into the `data/` folder.
- Templates include:
  - glucose_readings_template.csv
  - hba1c_readings_template.csv
  - supplies_template.csv

✅ This ensures the app has the correct structure even if no readings have been entered yet.

---

## 👨‍💻 About

This project was built to help manage diabetes more easily — track important readings, monitor trends, and keep your supplies organized, all from one simple app.

---

## 🔄 Resetting Data

To reset your app's data back to a clean state (blank templates):

1. Open your terminal inside the project folder.
2. Run:

```bash
python reset_data.py

*Built with love using Python and Streamlit.*
